# runes

A 3D-printable collection of runes

## Overview
The inspiration for this comes from my new copy of [The BOOK of RUNES](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276106.The_Book_of_Runes) by Ralph Blum which includes a handsome set of what appear to be clay runes.

> "Older than the New Testament, the Runes have lain fallow for more than 300 years. Akin in function to the Tarot and the Chinese Book of Changes, the Runes were last in current use in Iceland during the late Middle Ages. In their time they served as the I Ching of the Vikings."
>
> ~ Ralph Blum

And yet, there are many who suggest that Ralph Blum just made up a lot of what he wrote regarding the meanings. So you may want to consult other sources as well.

## History
Rune stones originated with ancient German and Nordic tribes. Their usage spread across Europe with Anglo-Saxons, and they are still a popular tool today. The word “rune” translates to “whisper” or “mystery”, which solidifies their usage in telling the untold.

## Examples of the glyphs

## 3-Stone Spread (reading)

From the [psychicgurus.org](https://www.psychicgurus.org/rune-casting/) website (noting that the ordinal number of the stones is from right to left as you face them):

> Focus on a little broader issue you may be struggling with, pick three stones, and lay them out in front of you. Meditate on what the stones may be telling you about your current situation. One way to interpret these stones is that the first is your current physical condition, the second is your present mental condition, and the third is your present spiritual condition.
>
> Another way to interpret a three-stone spread is that the first stone you pick gives you the answer to a past issue, the second stone is the answer to a present issue, and the final stone is the answer to a future issue.
