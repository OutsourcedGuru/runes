# runes

A 3D-printable collection of runes

## Overview
The inspiration for this comes from my new copy of "The BOOK of RUNES" by Ralph Blum which includes a handsome set of what appear to be clay runes.

> "Older than the New Testament, the Runes have lain fallow for more than 300 years. Akin in function to the Tarot and the Chinese Book of Changes, the Runes were last in current use in Iceland during the late Middle Ages. In their time they served as the I Ching of the Vikings."
